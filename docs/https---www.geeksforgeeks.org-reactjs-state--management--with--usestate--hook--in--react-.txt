useState is a built-in hook that empowers functional components to manage state directly, eliminating the need for class-based components or external state management libraries for simple use cases. It provides an easy mechanism to track dynamic data within a component, enabling it to React to user interactions and other events by re-rendering the UI when the state changes. In this article, you will learn about State Management with useState in react.Prerequisites:React JSNPM & NodeJSReactJS HooksBenefits of using useState:Simplicity: Makes state management intuitive and easy to understand.Readability: Promotes cleaner code, especially for simple state scenarios.Performance: Lightweight due to being part of the core React library.Integration: Works seamlessly with other React hooks and features.When to use useState:Managing simple, local state within a single component.State that doesn't need to be shared across multiple components.Creating interactive UI elements that respond to user actions.If your application's state becomes more complex or needs to be shared across multiple components, consider using a state management library like Redux or Context API.Approach to Manage State with useState Hook:To utilize useState , import it from the react library at the top of your component file:import React, { useState } from 'react';Within your functional component, call useState with the initial state value as an argument. It returns an array containing two elements:The Current state value: Use this in your JSX to display the data dynamically.A State update function: Call this function to modify the state and trigger a re-render of the component.Syntax:const [stateVariable, setStateVariable] = useState(initialState);Steps to Create React application:Step 1: Create a react application using the following command.npx create-react-application my-react-applicationStep 2: Naviate to the root directory of your application using the following command.cd my-react-applicationProject Structure:project structureThe updated dependencies in package.json f:"dependencies": {    "react": "^18.2.0",    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"}Example 1: Basic Counter with ButtonInitial state: count = 0Click "Increment": count = 1 (UI updates to reflect the new count)Click "Increment" again: count = 2 (UI updates again)

JavaScript

import React, {

useState

} from 'react';

function Counter() {

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

const handleClick = () => {

setCount(count + 1);

};

return (

<div>

<p>Count: {count}</p>

<button

onClick={handleClick}>

Increment

</button>

</div>

);

}

export default Counter;

Start your application using the following command.npm startOutput: Example 2: Input Field with Value TrackingInitial state: name = '' (input field is empty)Type "react": name = 'react' (input field shows "react")Type "geek for geeks": name = 'geek for geeks' (input field shows "geek for geeks")

JavaScript

import React, {

useState

}

from 'react';

function InputFeild() {

const [name, setName] = useState('');

const handleChange = (event) => {

setName(event.target.value);

}

return (

<div>

<label>Name:</label>

<input type="text"

value={name}

onChange={handleChange} />

<p>Entered name: {name}</p>

</div>

);

}

export default InputFeild;

Output:example 2 output
